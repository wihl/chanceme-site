          and then fretting until late March to find the results. Our
          team at Harvard's Data Science Class has analyzed more than
          13,000 applications to determine which factors matter most to
          the top twenty-five colleges in the USA. We have also built
          an <a href="http://www.chanceme.info/">online predictor</a>
          that lets a student or parent enter current results, see the
          chances of getting into an elite college. Even more
          importantly, the student can then change the values to see if
          time is better spent improving grades or playing more varsity
          sports.</p>

          <p>Standardized tests, GPA and the school the student is
          applying to are by far the most important factors that determine
          admission success. This should come as no surprise. What is
          surprising is how little other factors matter. Sports can be
          <a href="http://collegepuzzle.stanford.edu/?p=2088">a huge time sink</a>
          yet make no difference to a successful admission. Unless the
          student is a star recruited athlete, a fraction of the time
          spent on sports would be better spent improving standardized
          tests, especially the SAT or ACT score.</p>

          this advantage varies significantly by school. Carnegie
          Mellon gives the greatest boost to minorities, with an
          average increase of 149 points. Harvard is notably the only

          Their admission decision is not supposed to factor in the

          indeed to be the case: whether or not the candidate needed
          financial assistance had no affect on the acceptance
          decision. <strong>The acceptance rates, when all other
          factors were accounted for, remained the same irrespective of

          <p>Most of us have an intuitive sense about which factors of an
            application are most important for determining admissions. However,
            things get murky when we start to think about how each college might
            differentially weight the factors. Much of the uncertainty surrounding
            applying to Ivy League schools arises from the seeming randomness of
            admissions-- why should a 4.0 student with high SAT scores get into
            Harvard, but not Princeton or Yale? We aimed to quantify some over this
            inter-college variation.

            We asked whether being a legacy had different levels of importance in
            determining admissions across our 25 schools. We find that although
            legacy has a positive effect on admission at every school, it is
            especially important at the Ivy League schools, as well as at Stanford
            and MIT.</p>

            <p>Our results confirm the conventional wisdom that technical schools
              like MIT and CalTech, which have a low proportion of matriculating
              females, are more likely to admit women.</p>

          <p>We have provided some much-needed insight into the murky waters of the
            college admissions process. Our hope is that this information empowers
            students and their supporters to make informed decisions about
            priorities and factors to consider when applying to college. Clearly,
            SAT scores and GPA are the most important factors of an application.
            Students should focus on boosting their academic profiles in lieu of
            joining more and more extracurricular activities.  There are some
            limitations to our approach given the structure of our dataset.
            For example, we are unable to take account of any personal statements
            or recommendation letters, which are obviously very important in the
            application procedure. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
            analysis is the most extensive open-source tool available to high
            school students to date.</p>
